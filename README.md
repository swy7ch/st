- [st-clipboard](https://st.suckless.org/patches/clipboard/)
- [st-externalpipe](https://st.suckless.org/patches/externalpipe/)
- [st-font2](https://st.suckless.org/patches/font2/)
- [st-scrollback](https://st.suckless.org/patches/scrollback/)
- [st-xresources](https://st.suckless.org/patches/xresources/)
